Electric current appears when a flow of electrons due to the voltage traverse a wire.

The electric power industry is only a little more than 100 years old~\cite{Talati1998}.  1897 was the date Thomas Edison started commercial production of the electric bulp.  In 1886 the Alternating Current (AC) system has appeared to substutute the direct current system (DC). 

At the beginning, large scale plans were profitable, but then the price escalated. The Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act (1978) forced companies.

The energy market became open when the avoided cost became smaller than average cost, due to appearance of small companies which produce electricity. (self-generation, cogeneration). The policy forced companies to buy "excess" energy. this is a cost that the utility has avoided by not having to build a new generator. 

now generators are very efficient

The market became competitive. 

the price of individual consumers primarily determined by market forces, and regularoty policies.


Transimssion


transmission system is a tie from a generetor to end user. 
 69 kilovolts (kV) and 750 kV to end users. AC allows to step up and step down using substations. Substations usually have at least 2 transmission lines serving them.
